# Lia Formenti (she/elle)

## Physicist | Communicator | Coordinator

### HIGHLIGHTS
-> Worked on the ATLAS experiment at CERN for my M.Sc at McGill / I am a total physics nerd.

-> Wrote custom software to analyze data for my M.Sc project

-> Physics taught me to learn new programs / softwares / languages / techniques fast.

-> I like engaging with the public about science! I gave a public lecture in [May 2020](https://www.facebook.com/physicsmatters/videos/242040183882347/) and [March 2021](https://www.mcgill.ca/science/channels/event/bicentennial-stars-take-it-limit-mammoth-machines-and-tiniest-particles-327730) and made a [virtual lab tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjiKFaXYEOY&list=PLjGJ3WJ8V2n8YiCL02Kt4Wn5_o52XmjtC&ab_channel=LiaFormenti). This is why I took the job of Events Coordinator at Let's Talk Science! Currently (Jan 2023), I coordinate a [virtual panel series](https://letstalkscience.ca/events/symposiums) so secondary students across the country can engage with world-class science experts. 

### Main Tools / Technology
Python, C++, Git, Bash, SQLite

### I am looking for...

...mission-driven companies hiring data specialists. My training as a physicist has given me the technical skills to transition to data roles and my commitment to science education sets me apart as someone who can communicate technical information to diverse audiences.

Currently seeking roles in the field of climate science to be part of the solution to the greatest challenge of our time.
