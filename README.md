# Lia Formenti
## M.Sc. candidate at McGill | physicist | communicator | coordinator

### HIGHLIGHTS
-> Worked on the ATLAS experiment at CERN for my M.Sc / I am a total physics nerd.

-> Physics taught me to learn new programs / softwares / languages / techniques fast.

-> I like engaging with the public about science! I gave a public lecture in [May 2020](https://www.facebook.com/physicsmatters/videos/242040183882347/) and [March 2021](https://www.mcgill.ca/science/channels/event/bicentennial-stars-take-it-limit-mammoth-machines-and-tiniest-particles-327730). I also coordinate [monthly public lectures](https://physicsmatters.physics.mcgill.ca/past-lectures/).

### FUTURE
Maybe after I submit my thesis I'll try coding for fun more . . . 

Speaking of after submitting my thesis, I am seeking mission-driven companies to learn about as I search for my path after graduation, be it in technology or science communication. Specifically, I want to engage more with immediate local and global problems - like climate change, 
access to education, or building scientific agency.
